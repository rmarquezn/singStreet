        <h2>SING STREET</h2>
        <p>
          Deep within dublin, among a Fitzwilliam seemingly normal middle
          school, five teenagers dream of rocking the world. With daring soul,
          vintage sound and youthful lyrics, Sing Street brings back the 80's
          new wave and synthpop to the modern audience. Influenced by the band
          members parents' music, the legendary retro synths and chunky drum
          sets, the band accomplishes a nostalgic aesthetic through their songs.
          And following suit to the vintage sound, their style doesn't go
          unnoticed. As they pay homage to Robert Smith and David Bowie, makeup
          and flashy clothing become a staple for Sing Street's style. With a
          solid concept and a modern revival moment, the five talented musicians
          dream to take on the world by a nostalgic synth storm and share their
          music around the world.

        <h2>OUR SELF-TITLED ALBUM</h2>
        <div id="album">
          <p>
            Sing Street's self titled album encapsulates the whole identity of
            the band, their intentions of bringing back a golden era of music.
            Featuring a wide to their versatily sound, they include fast paced
            songs like Drive it Like You Stole It and beautifully contrast them
            with dreamy songs like Up. Despite the shorter length, a complex and
            remarkable sound is played throughout the quality of the album.
            Released in 2015 and produced in-house by the band, it is a reminder
            that the modern age has lifted technological limitations for
            delivering a professional sound.

            <h3>Conor</h3>
            <div class="us">
              <p>
                Born in dublin, Conor sings with a kindred heart and soulful
                lyrics. As a self taught singer and influenced by his bigger
                brother, he has sung his whole childhood blissfully. He is a fan
                of soccer since he was little and his favorite food are the
                delicious burgers from O'Connel's, a local business from his
                neighborhood.

            <div class="us">
              <p>
                Being the offspring of two musicians has a lot of influence on a
                young boy, and when Eamon picked up his father's guitar, he
                expectedly developed the same passion for sound. He enjoys
                playing guitar every chance he has, and is a cricual factor in
                the arrangement and composition of the majority of Sing Street's
                songs. He is really into videogames and he loves pizza.

              <p>
                Ngig brings the synth sounds to the band with astonishing ease.
                He has been learning piano since he was four years old, and
                discovered Emerson Lake and palmer at eight. Naturally, he
                passionately pursues the dream of music with the band, bringing
                his keyboard prowess to the music. He likes to cook with his
                grandmother and his favorite food is dumplings.
